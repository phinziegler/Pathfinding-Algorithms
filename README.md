WIP -- visualizer for search algorithms. 3/22/2022

This project allow the user to visualize various search algorithms on a grid.
The user will be able to paint walls, startpoints and endpoints, control the animation speed, view area, and more.

## TODO
<ol>
  <li>Implement search algorithms
    <ul>
      <li>Breadth First (Done)
      <li>(Clamped) Depth First
      <li>Greedy Best First
      <li>A* Search
      <li>Beam Search
      <li>etc
    </ul>
  <li>Animate searches (Done)
  <li>Make default offset such that the screen is in the middle of the board.
